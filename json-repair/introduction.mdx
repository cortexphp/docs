## About This Package

JSON Repair fixes malformed JSON from LLMs, APIs, and user input. It handles common syntax errors that cause `json_decode()` to fail: single quotes, unquoted keys, trailing commas, missing brackets, and more.

## Quick Example

```php
use function Cortex\JsonRepair\json_repair;

$broken = "{'name': 'John', age: 30, active: true,}";
$repaired = json_repair($broken);

// {"name": "John", "age": 30, "active": true}
```
